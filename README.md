# dailyCalendar_hw5

For this weeks assignment we were required to create a simple calendar application. In this application the user should be able to see timeblocks color coded representing time that has passed, current time, and the coming hours. The hours are from 9-5 and you can enter and save all your daily tasks in the corresponding time it needs to be completed. When you refresh the page all your inputs will be saved in local storage and you will stil be able to view them until you delete and save the new change.
